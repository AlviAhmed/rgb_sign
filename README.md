# rgb_sign 

This project is a project between the Shift-Register-Sign and my next planned 
project which are addressable rgb led strips. The store needed a sign quickly and since 
my shift register sign had a lot of bugs (mainly due to the finicky nature of hardware). 
I needed a stable option. In this project I made a sign that simply faded in and out of 
colours as simple as possible.
